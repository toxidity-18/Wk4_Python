## File Handling Challenge in Python

* The program asks the user for a filename.
* It **reads** the file content.
* Transforms the text (in this case, makes everything UPPERCASE).
* **Writes** the modified content into a new file called `modified_filename.txt`.
* Includes **error handling**:

  * If the file doesnâ€™t exist â†’ shows a friendly error.
  * Any other issues are also handled gracefully.

ðŸ’¡ You can change the modification step (e.g., lowercase, replace words, add lines, etc.) to practice.

Want me to make an **even shorter version without error handling** (just pure read/write), or do you want to keep the error handling in for practice?
