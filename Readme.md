## File Handling Challenge in Python

This is a simple Python challenge to practice **file handling** and **string manipulation**.  
The script takes a text file as input, modifies its content, and writes the result to a new file.

---

## How it works
1. The script reads an existing file (e.g. `test.txt`).
2. It processes the content (in this example, replaces words or modifies text).
3. It saves the new content into a new file with the prefix `Modified_Output_`.



## Usage
1. Create a text file to test (e.g. `test.txt`):

   ```txt
   Hello world.
   This is my test file.
  ```
## Run this code 
```bash 
    NB # Clone this repository
    git clone https://github.com/toxidity-18/Wk4_Python.git
    python main.py
```
- It might run the code successfully  or throw an error .
 2. A new file will be created in the same directory `Modified_Output_test.txt  `
 3. Or it might throw an error if the file is missing / nonexistent
